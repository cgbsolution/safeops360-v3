/**
 * Severity — pre-filled from the deterministic suggestion engine, always
 * editable, reason required when the observer disagrees.
 *
 * The problem this solves: Severity was a free dropdown with no relationship to
 * the STOP taxonomy, so identical hazard classifications were rated Low by one
 * observer and High by the next — which makes the category heat-map and every
 * severity trend unreadable.
 *
 * Rules the implementation holds to:
 *
 *   • **Nothing about severity is decided in the browser.** The suggested value,
 *     the rationale, the severity ladder and the minimum reason length all come
 *     from `/api/observations/severity-suggestion`. There is no copy of the
 *     matrix here to drift out of sync, and the server re-resolves at submit
 *     anyway — this component cannot grant or dodge the override requirement.
 *
 *   • **No rule ⇒ exactly the old behaviour.** A combination with no seeded rule
 *     renders a plain dropdown: no suggestion label, no reason field, no error.
 *     Reporting must never be blocked by unconfigured policy.
 *
 *   • **Suggested ≠ imposed.** The select is never disabled. The suggestion is
 *     a starting point with its reasoning attached, and disagreement is a
 *     first-class outcome that gets recorded rather than prevented.
